# Deadman-Scrum-Tool
A deadmans switch used during stand ups.

This project is for a deadman's switch that is passed around to different team members during a stand up. The user pushes a button on the device, then after 90 seconds, it begins buzzing to tell the user to end.

The suggestion for this came from a retrospective from a particularly time zealous scrum team.
